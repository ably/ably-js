- **--root**: The base directory inside the bucket to deploy to, defaults to `lib`.
- **--path**: The local path to retrieve source files from. Defaults to `.`.

#### AWS Access

Expects AWS access to be configured in the surrounding environment. To run
locally, first set some temporary AWS credentials as environment variables
using `ably-env`:

```
source <(ably-env secrets print-aws)
```

See [AWS Access](https://ably.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/665190401/AWS+Access)
for more information about gaining access to AWS.

### checkDocLinks.ts

Verifies every `ably.com/docs` URL referenced from `ably.d.ts`, `modular.d.ts` and `src/`:
that the page still resolves, and that a URL carrying a fragment still matches an element
id on the page it resolves to. A stale fragment is the failure worth catching, since a
browser given an unknown fragment silently leaves the reader at the top of the page.

Run with `npm run check-doc-links`. It takes about a minute: the docs site rate-limits
bursts, so pages are fetched one at a time.

URLs that are already broken are listed in the script's `KNOWN_BROKEN` map so the check
gates new breakage rather than the existing backlog. Fixing one means deleting its entry —
a listed URL that starts working is reported as a failure telling you to remove it.
