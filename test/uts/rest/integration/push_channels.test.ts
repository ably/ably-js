/**
 * UTS Integration: PushChannel Tests (RSH7)
 *
 * Spec points: RSH7a, RSH7b, RSH7c, RSH7d
 * Source: uts/rest/integration/push_channels.md
 *
 * These tests require the Push plugin to be loaded, and the local device to
 * be configurable. The PushChannel methods (subscribeDevice, subscribeClient,
 * unsubscribeDevice, unsubscribeClient) operate on behalf of the local device
 * and require push device authentication (RSH6).
 *
 * Since ably-js's PushChannel.subscribeDevice/unsubscribeDevice use
 * X-Ably-DeviceToken headers for push device auth, and the sandbox does not
 * issue real deviceIdentityTokens through the admin API, these integration
 * tests are skipped. The PushChannel API requires a genuine device activation
 * flow (RSH2) to obtain a valid deviceIdentityToken, which is not feasible
 * in a Node.js test environment.
 *
 * The subscribeClient/unsubscribeClient methods use client.auth.clientId
 * and do NOT require device registration or device auth headers, so they
 * could potentially work, but ably-js's implementation does not add device
 * auth headers for subscribeClient either — it just posts with standard
 * auth. However, the sandbox may still reject these without a proper push
 * setup.
