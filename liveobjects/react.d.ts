// Type declarations for the `ably/liveobjects/react` entry point under the
// classic `node`/`node10` module resolution, which resolves this subpath by
// filesystem path and does not read the package `exports` field. Modern
// resolvers (`node16`, `bundler`) reach the real declarations through
// `exports`. The runtime implementation is provided by `exports` in every
// resolver, since Node itself honours `exports` at runtime.
