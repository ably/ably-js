# UTS Test Deviations

Tracks confirmed ably-js non-compliance with the Ably spec. Each entry corresponds to a test that fails because ably-js behavior differs from the spec requirement. Tests assert spec behavior and are allowed to fail — the failures document genuine deviations.

Tests marked with `if (!process.env.RUN_DEVIATIONS) this.skip()` are skipped by default but can be run with `RUN_DEVIATIONS=1 npm run test:uts`.

## Skipped Deviations (RUN_DEVIATIONS=1 to run)

These tests assert spec behavior but are skipped by default because they are known to fail. Run with `RUN_DEVIATIONS=1` to execute them.

### realtime_client: RTC1a - echoMessages default does not send echo=true

**Spec (RTC1a)**: The `echoMessages` option (default true) should be sent as `echo=true` query parameter.

**ably-js behavior**: ably-js only sends `echo=false` when `echoMessages` is explicitly false. When `echoMessages` is true (default), no `echo` parameter is sent — the server defaults to echoing.

**Test**: `RTC1a - echoMessages default sends echo=true` — asserts `echo=true` per spec.

---

### channel_detach: RTL5k - ATTACHED while detached does not send DETACH

**Spec (RTL5k)**: If the channel receives an ATTACHED message while in the DETACHED state, it should send a new DETACH message.

**ably-js behavior**: ably-js re-enters 'attached' state instead of sending DETACH when ATTACHED is received while detached.

**Test**: `RTL5k - ATTACHED while detached sends DETACH` — asserts `detachMessageCount == 2` and `channel.state == 'detached'` per spec.

---

### presence_reentry: RTP17e - re-entry error message missing clientId

**Spec (RTP17e)**: Failed re-entry should emit UPDATE with error code 91004 and message indicating the failure and clientId.

**ably-js behavior**: The error message is `'Presence auto re-enter failed'` without including the clientId.

**Test**: `RTP17e - failed re-entry emits UPDATE with error` — asserts `message.includes('my-client')` per spec.

---

### channel_publish: RTL6i3 / RSL1e - null fields included in wire JSON

**Spec (RTL6i3/RSL1e)**: Null values should be omitted from wire JSON.

**ably-js behavior**: Includes `"data": null` instead of omitting the key. Similarly for `name`.

**Tests**: `RTL6i3 - null name/data fields handled correctly` (realtime), `RSL1e - null name omitted from body`, `RSL1e - null data omitted from body` (REST).

**Issue**: [#2199](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2199)

---

### connection_ping: RTN13d - ping does not defer in non-connected states

**Spec (RTN13d)**: Ping should be deferred until the connection reaches a resolvable state.

**ably-js behavior**: `ping()` immediately rejects with "not connected".

**Test**: `RTN13d - ping deferred from CONNECTING until CONNECTED`.

**Issue**: [#2203](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2203)

---

### client_id: RSA7b - auth.clientId not derived from TokenDetails (REST)

**Spec (RSA7b)**: The clientId attribute of the Auth object should be derived from tokenDetails returned from auth requests.

**ably-js behavior**: `auth.clientId` is only set from `ClientOptions.clientId`, not extracted from tokenDetails.

**Tests**: `RSA7b - clientId from TokenDetails`, `RSA7b - clientId from authCallback TokenDetails`, `RSA7 - clientId updated after authorize()`, `RSA12 - Wildcard clientId`, `RSA7 - case 5: clientId inherited from token`.

**Issue**: [#2192](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2192)

---

### token_renewal: RSA4b - Authorization header overwritten on retry / no retry limit

**Spec (RSA4b/RSC10)**: Token renewal should use the new token's header and retry at most once.

**ably-js behavior**: The retry sends the old token's authorization header. The retry loop is unbounded.

**Tests**: `RSA4b - renewal on 40142 error`, `RSC10 - transparent retry after renewal`, `RSA4b - renewal limit`.

**Issue**: [#2193](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2193)

---

### annotations: RSAN1a3 - type validation missing

**Spec (RSAN1a3)**: The SDK must validate that the user supplied a `type`.

**ably-js behavior**: `constructValidateAnnotation()` does not validate that `type` is present.

**Tests**: `RSAN1a3 - type required` (realtime), `RTAN1a - publish validates type is required` (REST).

**Issue**: [#2194](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2194)

---

### annotations: RSAN1c4 / RSC22d - idempotent IDs not generated

**Spec (RSAN1c4)**: Annotations with empty `id` should get a generated idempotent ID. **Spec (RSC22d)**: Same for batch publish.

**ably-js behavior**: Neither `RestAnnotations.publish()` nor `batchPublish()` generates idempotent IDs.

**Tests**: `RSAN1c4 - idempotent ID generated`, `RSC22d - batch publish generates idempotent IDs`.

**Issue**: [#2195](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2195)

---

### rest_client: RSC7c - addRequestIds not implemented

**Spec (RSC7c)**: The `addRequestIds` option should add a `request_id` query parameter to all REST requests.

**ably-js behavior**: The option is accepted but has no effect.

**Tests**: `RSC7c - request_id query param when addRequestIds is true`, `RSC22_Headers2 - request_id included when addRequestIds enabled`.

**Issue**: [#2196](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2196)

---

### fallback: RSC15l4 - CloudFront Server header does not trigger fallback

**Spec (RSC15l4)**: A response with a `Server: CloudFront` header and HTTP status `>= 400` should trigger fallback.

**ably-js behavior**: `shouldFallback` only receives the error object, not response headers. The `Server` header is not inspected anywhere in the fallback decision path.

**Tests**: `RSC15l4 - CloudFront Server header triggers fallback` (unit, `rest/unit/fallback.test.ts`; also skipped at integration tier in `rest/integration/proxy/rest_fallback.test.ts`).

**Issue**: [#2197](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2197)

---

### fallback: REC1b2 - IPv6 endpoint address not bracketed

**Spec (REC1b2)**: IPv6 addresses should be supported as endpoint values.

**ably-js behavior**: URL construction produces `https://::1:443/time` instead of `https://[::1]:443/time`.

**Test**: `REC1b2 - endpoint as IPv6 address`.

**Issue**: [#2198](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2198)

---

### options_types: AO2 - authMethod default not stored

**Spec (AO2)**: `authMethod` should default to `'GET'` and be stored in auth options.

**ably-js behavior**: Default `authMethod` is not stored.

**Test**: `AO2 - authMethod defaults to GET`.

**Issue**: [#2205](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2205)

---

### presence_message_types: TP3h - memberKey not exposed

**Spec (TP3h)**: `PresenceMessage` should expose a `memberKey` property.

**ably-js behavior**: `memberKey` is not exposed on `PresenceMessage`.

**Test**: `TP3h - memberKey format`.

**Issue**: [#2202](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2202)

---

### channels: RTL4c - errorReason not cleared on successful re-attach

**Spec (RTL4c, proposed)**: When a confirmation ATTACHED is received, the channel's errorReason should be set to null.

**ably-js behavior**: After a channel enters FAILED state, a subsequent successful `attach()` does not clear `errorReason`.

**Note**: This is a proposed spec change (see [specification#459](https://github.com/ably/specification/issues/459)).

**Tests**: `RTL4g - errorReason cleared on re-attach from FAILED`, `RTL4g - errorReason cleared on re-attach and detach`.

---

### presence_sync: RTP18a - new sync does not discard in-flight sync

**Spec (RTP18a)**: If a new SYNC sequence begins while one is in progress, the previous sync should be discarded.

**ably-js behavior**: Does not discard the previous sync.

**Test**: `RTP18a - new sync discards previous in-flight sync`.

---

### integration/auth: RSC10 - token renewal infinite loop with expired JWT

**Spec (RSC10)**: When a REST request fails with a token error (40140-40149), the client should renew the token and retry.

**ably-js behavior**: Same root cause as the unit test RSA4b deviation — `withAuthDetails` overwrites the new authorization header with the stale one from the previous attempt, causing an infinite retry loop. Confirmed against the sandbox: the authCallback is called hundreds of times, each returning a valid JWT, but the request always sends the old expired token.

**Test**: `RSC10 - token renewal with expired JWT` in `rest/integration/auth.test.ts`.

**Issue**: [#2193](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/2193) (same root cause as unit test deviations RSA4b/RSC10)

---

### integration/push_admin: RSH1b2 - push device list pagination missing Link headers

**Spec (RSH1b2)**: `deviceRegistrations.list` with `limit` should support pagination via `hasNext()`.

**Server behavior**: The push admin `GET /push/deviceRegistrations` endpoint does not return `Link` headers when `limit` is used, even when more results exist. With 3 devices registered and `limit=2`, the response returns 2 items but `hasNext()` is false because there is no `Link: rel="next"` header.

**Test**: `RSH1b2 - list supports pagination with limit` in `rest/integration/push_admin.test.ts`.

**Issue**: [ably/realtime#8380](https://github.com/ably/realtime/issues/8380)

---

### objects/live_map_api: RTLM24 - clear() not implemented

**Spec (RTLM24)**: `LiveMap#clear()` sends a MAP_CLEAR operation.

**ably-js behavior**: `LiveMap#clear()` does not exist yet; the incoming MAP*CLEAR \_apply* path (RTLM24a-c) is implemented and tested.

**Test**: `RTLM24 - clear() sends MAP_CLEAR message (not yet implemented)` — an `it.skip` placeholder in `objects/unit/live_map_api.test.ts`.

---

## Adapted Deviations (tests modified to match ably-js behavior)

These tests have been adapted from the UTS spec to account for ably-js API differences. The test still validates the underlying behavior but uses ably-js's actual API surface.

### objects/value_types: RTLMV4b - key-type validation untranslatable to JavaScript

**Spec (RTLMV4b)**: `objects/unit/RTLMV4b/evaluate-validates-keys-0` — LiveMap value type consumption validates that entry keys are strings.

**ably-js behavior**: JavaScript object keys are always coerced to strings, so a non-string key cannot reach the validation. The test is omitted (the only spec Test ID without a derived test); the sibling RTLMV4a/RTLMV4c validation tests cover the reachable cases.

---

### objects (all files): spec `null` absent values asserted as `undefined`

**Spec**: UTS spec assertions use `== null` for absent values (nonexistent keys, tombstoned entries, failed value()/instance()/size()/compact() lookups). The features spec (`objects-features.md` RTLM5d1/RTLM5d2h/RTLM5e etc.) defines these as "undefined/null", deliberately language-mapped.

**ably-js behavior**: Returns `undefined`, the idiomatic JavaScript mapping.

**Tests**: Systematic across `objects/unit/path_object.test.ts`, `instance.test.ts`, `live_map_api.test.ts`, `path_object_mutations.test.ts` and the `objects/integration` suites — assertions use `to.be.undefined` wherever the spec says `== null`.

---

### objects/live_object_subscribe: RTLC9h - missing-number COUNTER_INC not treated as noop

**Spec (RTLC9h, via RTLO4b4c1)**: A COUNTER_INC whose `counterInc` carries no `number` is a noop — it must not fire subscription listeners.

**ably-js behavior**: `_applyCounterInc` (`src/plugins/liveobjects/livecounter.ts`) applies `op.number` unconditionally, so a missing number becomes `NaN` and an update event fires. Related to the RTLC9 NaN deviation documented in `live_counter.test.ts`.

**Test**: `objects/unit/RTLO4b4c1/noop-no-trigger-0` — adapted to use a COUNTER_CREATE for an object whose create op is already merged (RTLC8), a genuine noop in ably-js, so the RTLO4b4c1 suppression path is still exercised; the spec's follow-up control increment and `updates.length == 2` assertion are kept.

---

### objects/live_counter: RTLC9 / RTLC16 - missing-field counter ops applied instead of noop

**Spec (RTLC9, RTLC16)**: A COUNTER_INC whose `counterInc.number` is absent is a noop (RTLC9), and a COUNTER_CREATE whose `count` is absent is a noop (RTLC16).

**ably-js behavior**: `_applyCounterInc` applies the missing number as `undefined`, so the counter's data becomes `NaN` (RTLC9); a missing `count` is treated as `0` and produces a normal update (`amount: 0`) with `createOperationIsMerged = true` (RTLC16). The listener-facing side of the RTLC9 gap is the RTLC9h entry above.

**Tests** (`objects/unit/live_counter.test.ts`): `RTLC9 - COUNTER_INC with missing number results in NaN (deviation: spec expects noop)`, `RTLC16 - COUNTER_CREATE with missing count defaults to 0 (deviation: spec expects noop)` — adapted to assert the applied result.

---

### objects/live_counter & live_map: RTLO4a / RTLC7d3 / RTLM9b / RTLM15d4 - applyOperation throws instead of returning false

**Spec**: `canApplyOperation`/`applyOperation` return `false` (with a logged warning) for an empty `serial`/`siteCode` (RTLO4a), an unsupported counter action (RTLC7d3), both serials empty (RTLM9b, via the RTLO4a3/RTLM15b gate), and an unsupported map action (RTLM15d4).

**ably-js behavior**: all four paths throw `ErrorInfo` 92000 at the same gate instead of returning `false` — one throw-instead-of-false family.

**Tests**: `RTLO4a - canApplyOperation throws on empty serial or siteCode (deviation: spec expects false)` and `RTLC7d3 - Unsupported action throws (deviation: spec expects false)` (`live_counter.test.ts`); `RTLM9b - both serials empty rejects operation (deviation: throws on empty serial)` and `RTLM15d4 - unsupported action throws (deviation: spec expects false)` (`live_map.test.ts`) — all adapted to assert the throw.

---

### objects/live_counter_api: RTLC12e1 - null increment amount defaults to 1 instead of failing

**Spec (RTLC12e1)**: `increment(null)` is one of the invalid-amount table rows and must fail with 40003.

**ably-js behavior**: the API signature is `increment(amount?: number)` and the implementation treats null as "no argument" (`amount ?? 1`), so `increment(null)` succeeds as `increment(1)` — the null row is unreachable as an error.

**Test**: `RTLC12e1 - table-driven invalid increment amounts` (`objects/unit/live_counter_api.test.ts`) — the null row is excluded; the remaining rows (NaN, ±Infinity, string, boolean, array, object) assert 40003.

---

### objects/live_object_subscribe: RTLO4b4d - objectMessage exposed as `.message`

**Spec (RTLO4b4d)**: `LiveObjectUpdate.objectMessage` carries the source ObjectMessage.

**ably-js behavior**: `InstanceSubscriptionEvent` exposes the public ObjectMessage as `.message` (not `.objectMessage`). The operation action is a string (`'counter.inc'`) instead of the internal numeric constant.

**Test**: Adapted to use `updates[0].message` and string action names.

---

### objects/live_object_subscribe: RTLO4b4e - tombstone flag not on InstanceSubscriptionEvent

**Spec (RTLO4b4e)**: `LiveObjectUpdate.tombstone` indicates whether the update was a tombstone.

**ably-js behavior**: `InstanceSubscriptionEvent` does not expose a `tombstone` field. The tombstone behavior (deregistering listeners) works internally, but is not surfaced to the user-facing event.

**Test**: Adapted to verify the event is delivered and check the operation action (`'object.delete'` for tombstone, `'counter.inc'` for normal) instead of asserting `.tombstone`.

---

### objects/live_object_subscribe: RTLO4b4c3c - tombstone flag not checkable

**Spec (RTLO4b4c3c)**: Tombstone update deregisters all listeners, and `update.tombstone == true`.

**ably-js behavior**: Tombstone deregistration works correctly (subsequent events do not fire), but `InstanceSubscriptionEvent` does not expose `.tombstone`. Test adapted to skip the `.tombstone` assertion.

---

### objects/realtime_object: RTO15 - publish result serials not exposed

**Spec (RTO15)**: `publish()` returns `PublishResult` with `.serials`.

**ably-js behavior**: PathObject mutation methods (`increment`, `set`, etc.) return `void` via `publishAndApply`. The `PublishResult.serials` are consumed internally for apply-on-ACK and not returned to the caller.

**Test**: Removed `result.serials` assertion.

---

### objects/realtime_object: RTO25b - DETACHED reached via client-side detach

**Spec (RTO25b)**: The access-precondition test reaches DETACHED via a server-initiated DETACHED protocol message.

**ably-js behavior**: An unsolicited DETACHED while ATTACHED triggers an automatic re-attach (RTL13a), so the channel never stays DETACHED. The test detaches client-side (`channel.detach()`) instead; the precondition assertion (`root.keys()` throws 90001) is unchanged.

Note: the former, broader entry here ("channel.object.get() re-attaches on DETACHED") retired with [specification#499](https://github.com/ably/specification/pull/499) — the re-attach behavior is now spec-mandated (RTO23e/RTL33), and RTO25b tests exercise `root.keys()`.

---

### objects: PathObject.subscribe argument order

**Spec**: pseudocode passes options first — `subscribe({ depth: n }, listener)`.

**ably-js behavior**: `PathObject.subscribe(listener, options?)` takes the listener first.

**Tests**: All subscribe-with-options tests use the ably-js argument order. (The former depth-_semantics_ entry retired with [specification#499](https://github.com/ably/specification/pull/499), which adopted ably-js's self-counts-as-depth-1 model.)

---

### objects/realtime_object: RTO20e1 - channel forced to FAILED via ERROR instead of DETACHED

**Spec (RTO20e1)**: If the channel enters DETACHED/SUSPENDED/FAILED while publishAndApply waits for SYNCED, the pending operation fails with 92008. The unit spec injects a DETACHED protocol message to trigger this.

**ably-js behavior**: Receiving DETACHED while ATTACHED triggers an automatic re-attach (RTL13a) rather than leaving the channel in DETACHED, so the sync wait never observes the state change. The 92008 path is exercised instead by injecting a channel ERROR, which puts the channel into FAILED.

**Test**: `objects/unit/RTO20e1/fails-on-channel-detached-0` (`RTO20e1 - publishAndApply fails when channel enters FAILED during sync wait`) — adapted to inject ERROR (FAILED) instead of DETACHED. The proxy integration test `objects/proxy/RTO20e/publish-fails-on-channel-failed-0` uses the same ERROR-based sequence, which the spec itself adopted in [specification#501](https://github.com/ably/specification/pull/501).

---

## Spec Points Under Review (compliant, but questioned)

### objects/realtime_object: RTO18d - additive listener registration is a questioned spec point

**Spec (RTO18d / RTE4)**: registering the same listener instance twice for a sync-state event makes it fire twice per emission (additive registration).

**ably-js behavior**: **compliant** — ably-js's `EventEmitter` is list-backed, so the same listener registered twice fires twice; `RTO18d - Duplicate listener registered twice fires twice` passes.

**Why it's here**: the spec point itself is considered questionable — a listener registered twice runs identical logic, so invoking it twice for one event has no practical purpose. ably-java intentionally deviates (its core `EventEmitter` deduplicates by listener instance, firing once) and documents this as a deliberate deviation. Recorded here as a flag for spec reconsideration; ably-js is **not** changed (its behavior currently follows the spec). If the spec point is removed/relaxed, or if alignment on de-duplication is agreed, this becomes a no-op.

---

## Mock Infrastructure Limitations

### MsgPack encoding/decoding not supported

The UTS mock HTTP infrastructure operates at the JSON level. It has no mechanism to encode/decode msgpack binary format.

**Tests affected (10 skipped)**:

- `RSL4c` — binary data with msgpack protocol
- `RSL6` — msgpack bin/str type decoding (2 tests)
- `RSC8a` — default msgpack protocol Content-Type
- `RSC8d` — mismatched Content-Type response
- `RSC8e` — unsupported Content-Type response
- `RSC8` — msgpack error response decoding
- `RSC19c` — msgpack request headers/body/response (3 tests)
