## [2.0.0](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/tree/2.0.0) (2024-03-22)

The 2.0.0 release introduces a number of new features and QoL improvements, including a new way to remove bloat and reduce the bundle size of your ably-js client, first-class support for Promises, a more idiomatic approach to using ably-js' React Hooks, enhancements to TypeScript typings, and more.

Below is an overview of the major changes in this release.

Please refer to the ably-js v2 [lib migration guide](./docs/migration-guides/v2/lib.md) and [React Hooks migration guide](./docs/migration-guides/v2/react-hooks.md) for the full details, including a list of all breaking changes and instructions on how to address them.

### Bundle Size Reduction

The default bundle size for the web has been reduced by ~32% compared to v1 - from 234.11 KiB to 159.32 KiB. When calculated with gzip compression, the reduction is ~30%, from 82.54 KiB to 57.9 KiB.

Additionally, by utilizing the new modular variant of the library (see below) and JavaScript tree shaking, you can create your own minimal useful `Realtime` client and achieve a bundle size reduction of ~60.5% compared to v1 - from 234.11 KiB to 92.38 KiB (or ~66% for gzip: from 82.54 KiB to 28.18 KiB).

### Modular variant of the library

An ESM variant of the library is now available for browsers (but not for Node.js) via import from `ably/modular`. This modular variant of the library supports tree shaking, allowing for a reduction in the Ably bundle size within your application and improving the user experience. It can also be used by Web Workers.

### React Hooks changes

React Hooks, exported at `ably/react`, now require the new `ChannelProvider` component to define the channels you wish to use and the options for them. This addresses the complexities previously encountered with `useChannel` and `usePresence` hooks when attempting to dynamically change options for a channel and provides a more straightforward approach to set and manage these options.

The functionality of the `usePresence` hook has been split into two separate hooks: `usePresence`, which is now used only to enter presence, and `usePresenceListener`, which is used to listen for presence updates. These new hooks offer better control over the desired presence behavior in your React components.

### First-class support for Promises

The callbacks API has been entirely removed, and the library now supports promises for all its asynchronous operations by default.

### TypeScript typings

The Types namespace has been removed. All types it contained are now exported at the top level.

### Browser and Web Worker bundles

- The browser bundle now relies on the native Web Crypto API instead of CryptoJS. The `ably/build/ably.noencryption` bundle has been removed, as it is no longer necessary.
- The browser bundle can now be directly used by Web Workers. The `ably/build/ably-webworker` bundle has been removed, as it is no longer necessary.

### Supported platforms changes

- Support for Internet Explorer has been dropped.
- Support for Node.js versions lower than 16 has been dropped. The supported Node.js versions are now 16, 18, and 20.
- The minimum supported versions for major browsers are: Chrome 58, Firefox 52, Edge 79, Safari 11, and Opera 45.

In the latest release of ably-js, we’ve added jsdoc comments for the public methods and properties provided by the SDK so you can quickly access the descriptions directly in your code editor using Intelligent code completion features like Intellisense in VSCode.

We have also implemented the fetch API as a fallback HTTP transport so that ably-js is now fully functional in a service worker context.

**How do I give feedback?**
This docs update and further planned changes are based on feedback from customers like you. So if you’d like to share any other requests or feedback, please [reach out to us](https://ably.com/contact) and help us make Ably better for everyone.

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/tree/1.2.1) (2020-06-09)

**Oops!** :blush: Fixes an oversight in our 1.2.0 release.

We had
[specified](https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/features/#TO3n)
that we would make `idempotentRestPublishing` default to `true` from version 1.2 (`ClientOptions`) but hadn't followed through with this.
That is fixed in this release with
[\#665](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/665)
([SimonWoolf](https://github.com/SimonWoolf)).

## [1.2](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/tree/1.2.0) (2020-06-08)

Adds the capability to subscribe to a channel in delta mode.

Subscribing to a channel in delta mode enables [delta compression](https://www.ably.com/docs/realtime/channels/channel-parameters/deltas). This is a way for a client to subscribe to a channel so that message payloads sent contain only the difference (ie the delta) between the present message and the previous message on the channel.

- Log and emit errors that occur on-connect (resume failures and upgrade failures) [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291)

- Rework upgrade flow so that all messages complete on one transport before switching to another, to avoid 'Invalid transport ID' message race condition [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291)

- Fix issue [\#285](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/285) where a detach that happens during a presence sync could fail (also [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291))

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/0.8.19...0.8.20)

**Biggest changes:**

- Rewrite the transport fallback sequence. It now starts with a polling transport (since some proxies break streaming transports) and then tries to upgrade to a websocket and streaming transport in parallel, picking the websocket if possible. It also remembers the best transport that worked (using HTML5 localstorage) and jumps straight to that if it can. [\#279](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/279)
