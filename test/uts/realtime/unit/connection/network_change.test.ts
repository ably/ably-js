/**
 * UTS: Network Change Tests
 *
 * Spec points: RTN20, RTN20a, RTN20b, RTN20c
 * Source: specification/uts/realtime/unit/connection/network_change_test.md
 *
 * RTN20 defines how the client should respond to OS-level network connectivity
 * change events. The spec begins with "When the client library can subscribe to
 * OS events for network/internet connectivity changes" -- this means the feature
 * is optional for platforms where network monitoring is not feasible.
 *
 * ably-js Node.js does not subscribe to OS network change events. The RTN20
 * functionality is browser-only (using navigator.onLine and online/offline
 * window events). Since these tests run in Node.js, all RTN20 tests are
 * marked as pending.
