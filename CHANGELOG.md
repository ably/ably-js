# Change Log

This contains only the most important and/or user-facing changes; for a full changelog, see the commit history.

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/tree/1.2.1) (2020-06-09)

**Oops!** :blush: Fixes an oversight in our 1.2.0 release.

We had
[specified](https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/features/#TO3n)
that we would make `idempotentRestPublishing` default to `true` from version 1.2 (`ClientOptions`) but hadn't followed through with this.
That is fixed in this release with
[\#665](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/665)
([SimonWoolf](https://github.com/SimonWoolf)).

## [1.2](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/tree/1.2.0) (2020-06-08)

Adds the capability to subscribe to a channel in delta mode.

Subscribing to a channel in delta mode enables [delta compression](https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/channels/channel-parameters/deltas). This is a way for a client to subscribe to a channel so that message payloads sent contain only the difference (ie the delta) between the present message and the previous message on the channel.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/0.8.21...0.8.22)

**Biggest changes:**

- Log and emit errors that occur on-connect (resume failures and upgrade failures) [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291)

- Rework upgrade flow so that all messages complete on one transport before switching to another, to avoid 'Invalid transport ID' message race condition [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291)

- Fix issue [\#285](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/285) where a detach that happens during a presence sync could fail (also [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291))

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/0.8.19...0.8.20)

**Biggest changes:**

- Rewrite the transport fallback sequence. It now starts with a polling transport (since some proxies break streaming transports) and then tries to upgrade to a websocket and streaming transport in parallel, picking the websocket if possible. It also remembers the best transport that worked (using HTML5 localstorage) and jumps straight to that if it can. [\#279](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/279)

- Fix crypto bug when generating random data in IE 8 and 9 [\#282](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/282)
