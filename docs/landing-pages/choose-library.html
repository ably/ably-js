    <h1>Ably JavaScript Client Library SDK API Reference</h1>

    <p>
    The JavaScript Client Library SDK supports a realtime and a REST interface. The JavaScript API references are generated from the <a href="https://github.com/ably/ably-js/">Ably JavaScript Client Library SDK source code</a> using <a href="https://jsdoc.app/">JSDoc</a> and structured by classes.
    </p>

    <p>
    The realtime interface enables a client to maintain a persistent connection to Ably and publish, subscribe and be present on channels. The REST interface is stateless and typically implemented server-side. It is used to make requests such as retrieving statistics, token authentication and publishing to a channel.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are two API variants of the Ably JavaScript Client Library SDK:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="default/index.html">Callback-based</a> (default)</li>
      <li><a href="promises/index.html">Promise-based</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    View the <a href="https://ably.com/docs/">Ably docs</a> for conceptual information on using Ably, and for API references featuring all languages. The combined <a href="https://ably.com/docs/api/">API references</a> are organized by features and split between the <a href="https://ably.com/docs/api/realtime-sdk">realtime</a> and <a href="https://ably.com/docs/api/rest-sdk">REST</a> interfaces.
